# Twitter-gathering

1.	twit_madness - downloading tweets, filtered by the hashtag, personal token for twitter API is required.

2.	cleaning - tweets, gathered from the twitter API contain unnecessary characters, links, etc. So, if we check the length of the raw tweets, there will be tweets, which are much longer then 140 characters.

This picture below illustrates the state before cleaning.
