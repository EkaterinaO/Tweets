# Twitter-gathering

1. twitter madness - downloading twitts, filterd by the hashtag, personal token for twitter api is required.

2. cleaning  - twitts, gathered from the twitter API cointain unnesesary charecters, links, ect.
So, if we check the length of the raw twitts, there will be twitts, which are much longer then 140 characters.

This picture below illustrates the state before cleaning.
